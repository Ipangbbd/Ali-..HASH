## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ipangbbd/Ali-..HASH.git
   cd cypher-core
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be available in the `dist` directory.

## 📖 How It Works

### Encoding Process
1. Input plain text is analyzed to generate a unique transformation matrix
2. Position-based character transformation is applied using deterministic algorithms
3. Integrity checksum is calculated for tamper detection
4. Result is encoded in Base64 for safe transport and storage

### Decoding Process
1. Base64 payload is decoded and validated
2. Components are extracted (header, checksum, transformed data)
3. Reverse transformation is applied using position-based calculations
4. Integrity is verified against the original checksum
5. Original text is reconstructed and returned

### Security Features
- **Deterministic Transformation**: Same input always produces same output
- **Integrity Verification**: Built-in tamper detection
- **Format Validation**: Automatic detection of valid encoded text
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for troubleshooting

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Secure Note Taking**: Encode sensitive information for storage
- **Data Obfuscation**: Transform text for privacy in shared environments
- **Educational Tool**: Demonstrate cryptographic concepts
- **Development Testing**: Generate test data with reversible transformations
- **Privacy Protection**: Obscure sensitive text in screenshots or logs

## 🔒 Security Considerations

While Ali-..HASH provides robust text transformation, please note:
- This is designed for text obfuscation, not military-grade encryption
- For highly sensitive data, consider additional security measures
- The transformation is deterministic and reversible by design
- No cryptographic keys are required, making it fully autonomous

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

### Development Guidelines
- Follow the existing code style and structure
- Ensure all components are properly typed with TypeScript
- Maintain the cyberpunk aesthetic in any UI changes
- Test thoroughly across different browsers and devices
